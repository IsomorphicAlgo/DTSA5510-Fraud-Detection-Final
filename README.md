# DTSA5510-Fraud-Detection-Final
Final project for the DTSA 5510 Unsupervised Learning Methods Class


This Jupyter Notebook explores the fascinating world of unsupervised learning for credit card fraud detection. We'll delve into a real-world dataset, uncovering hidden patterns and anomalies using powerful algorithms like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor. Through careful data exploration, preprocessing, and model optimization, we aim to identify fraudulent transactions effectively. Join us as we navigate the challenges of imbalanced data and leverage the strengths of these techniques to build a robust fraud detection system.
